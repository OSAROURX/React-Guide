            As its official tagline states, React is a library for building user
            interfaces. React is not a framework – it's not even exclusive to
            the web. It's used with other libraries to render to certain
            environments. For instance, React Native can be used to build mobile
            applications; React 360 can be used to build virtual reality
            applications; and there are other possibilities besides.
          </p>
          <p>
            To build for the web, developers use React in tandem with ReactDOM.
            React and ReactDOM are often discussed in the same spaces as — and
            utilized to solve the same problems as — other true web development
            frameworks. When we refer to React as a "framework", we’re working
            with that colloquial understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            React's primary goal is to minimize the bugs that occur when
            developers are building UIs. It does this through the use of
            components — self-contained, logical pieces of code that describe a
            portion of the user interface. These components can be composed
            together to create a full UI, and React abstracts away much of the
            rendering work, leaving you to concentrate on the UI design.
          </p>

        <article>
          <p>
            Unlike the other frameworks covered in this module, React does not
            enforce strict rules around code conventions or file organization.
            This allows teams to set conventions that work best for them, and to
            adopt React in any way they would like to. React can handle a single
            button, a few pieces of an interface, or an app's entire user
            interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            While React can be used for small pieces of an interface, it's not
            as easy to "drop into" an application as a library like jQuery, or
            even a framework like Vue — it is more approachable when you build
            your entire app with React.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, many of the developer-experience benefits of a React
            app, such as writing interfaces with JSX, require a compilation
            process. Adding a compiler like Babel to a website makes the code on
            it run slowly, so developers often set up such tooling with a build
            step. React arguably has a heavy tooling requirement, but it can be
            learned.

          <h2>How does React use JavaScript</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            React utilizes features of modern JavaScript for many of its
            patterns. Its biggest departure from JavaScript comes with the use
            of JSX syntax. JSX extends JavaScript's syntax so that HTML-like
            code can live alongside it. For example:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              const heading = &lt;h1&gt;Mozilla Developer Network&lt;/h1&gt;;
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            This heading constant is known as a JSX expression. React can use it
            to render that <code> &lt;h1&gt; </code> tag in our app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suppose we wanted to wrap our heading in a
            <code> &lt;header&gt; </code> tag, for semantic reasons? The JSX
            approach allows us to nest our elements within each other, just like
            we do with HTML:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  const header = (
    &lt;header&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Mozilla Developer Network&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
  );
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Of course, your browser can't read JSX without help. When compiled
            (using a tool like Babel or Parcel), our header expression would
            look like this:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  const header = React.createElement("header", null,
    React.createElement("h1", null, "Mozilla Developer Network")
  );
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            It's possible to skip the compilation step and use
            React.createElement() to write your UI yourself. In doing this,
            however, you lose the declarative benefit of JSX, and your code
            becomes harder to read. Compilation is an extra step in the
            development process, but many developers in the React community
            think that the readability of JSX is worthwhile. Plus, popular
            tooling makes the JSX-to-JavaScript compilation part of its setup
            process. You don't have to configure compilation yourself unless you
            want to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because JSX is a blend of HTML and JavaScript, some developers find
            it intuitive. Others say that its blended nature makes it confusing.
            Once you're comfortable with it, however, it will allow you to build
            user interfaces more quickly and intuitively, and allow others to
            better understand your codebase at a glance.

          <p>
            There are many ways to use React, but we're going to use the
            command-line interface (CLI) tool create-react-app, as mentioned
            earlier, which expedites the process of developing a React
            application by installing some packages and creating some files for
            you, handling the tooling described above.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's possible to add React to a website without create-react-app by
            copying some <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements into an HTML file,
            but the create-react-app CLI is a common starting point for React
            applications. Using it will allow you spend more time building your
            app, and less time fussing with setup.
          </p>
          <h3>Requirements:</h3>
          <p>
            In order to use create-react-app, you need to have Node.js
            installed. It's recommended that you use the long-term support (LTS)
            version. Node includes npm (the node package manager), and npx (the
            node package runner).
          </p>
          <p>
            You may also use the Yarn package manager as an alternative, but
            we'll assume you are using npm in this set of tutorials. See Package
            management basics for more information on npm and yarn.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're using Windows, you will need to install some software to
            give you parity with Unix/macOS terminal in order to use the
            terminal commands mentioned in this tutorial.
            <strong>Gitbash</strong> (which comes as part of the git for Windows
            toolset) or <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</strong> are
            both suitable. See Command line crash course for more information on
            these, and on terminal commands in general.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Also bear in mind that React and ReactDOM produce apps that only
            work on a fairly modern set of browsers — IE9+ by way of some
            polyfills. It is recommended that you use a modern browser like
            Firefox, Safari, or Chrome when working through these tutorials.
          </p>
          <h3>Initializing your app:</h3>
          <p>
            create-react-app takes one argument: the name you'd like to give
            your app. create-react-app uses this name to make a new directory,
            then creates the necessary files inside it. Make sure you
            <code>cd</code> to the place you'd like your app to live on your
            hard drive, then run the following in your terminal:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  npx create-react-app moz-todo-react
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            This creates a moz-todo-react directory, and does several things
            inside it:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Installs some npm packages essential to the functionality of the
              app.
            </li>
            <li>Writes scripts for starting and serving the application.</li>
            <li>
              Creates a structure of files and directories that define the basic
              app architecture.
            </li>
            <li>
              Initializes the directory as a git repository, if you have git
              installed on your computer.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When the process is complete, <code>cd</code> into the
            <code>moz-todo-react</code> directory and run the command
            <code>npm start</code>. The scripts installed by create-react-app
            will start being served at a local server at localhost:3000, and
            open the app in a new browser tab. Your browser will display
            something like this:
          </p>
          <div class="image">
            <img
              src="https://i.ibb.co/YRqfwBv/react-web.png"
              alt="default create react app"
              width="150px"
            />
          </div>
          <h3>Application structure:</h3>
          <p>
            create-react-app gives us everything we need to develop a React
            application. Its initial file structure looks like this:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  moz-todo-react
  &#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; README.md

            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            The <code><strong>src</strong></code> directory is where we'll spend
            most of our time, as it's where the source code for our application
            lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code><strong>public</strong></code> directory contains files
            that will be read by your browser while you're developing the app;
            the most important of these is <code>index.html</code>. React
            injects your code into this file so that your browser can run it.
            There's some other markup that helps create-react-app function, so
            take care not to edit it unless you know what you're doing. You very
            much should change the text inside the
            <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element in this file to reflect the title
            of your application. Accurate page titles are important for
            accessibility!

          <p>
            In React, a component is a reusable module that renders a part of
            our app. These parts can be big or small, but they are usually
            clearly defined: they serve a single, obvious purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's open <code>src/App.js</code>, since our browser is prompting
            us to edit it. This file contains our first component,
            <code>App</code>, and a few other lines of code:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
  import logo from &#x27;./logo.svg&#x27;;
  import &#x27;./App.css&#x27;;

  function App() {
    return (
      &#x3C;div className=&#x22;App&#x22;&#x3E;
        &#x3C;header className=&#x22;App-header&#x22;&#x3E;
          &#x3C;img src={logo} className=&#x22;App-logo&#x22; alt=&#x22;logo&#x22; /&#x3E;
          &#x3C;p&#x3E;
            Edit &#x3C;code&#x3E;src/App.js&#x3C;/code&#x3E; and save to reload.
          &#x3C;/p&#x3E;
          &#x3C;a
            className=&#x22;App-link&#x22;
            href=&#x22;https://reactjs.org&#x22;
            target=&#x22;_blank&#x22;
            rel=&#x22;noopener noreferrer&#x22;
          &#x3E;
            Learn React
          &#x3C;/a&#x3E;
        &#x3C;/header&#x3E;
      &#x3C;/div&#x3E;
    );
  }
  export default App;
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            The <code>App.js</code> file consists of three main parts: some
            <code>import</code> statements at the top, the
            <code>App</code> component in the middle, and an
            <code>export</code> statement at the bottom. Most React components
            follow this pattern.

        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Let’s open <code>src/index.js</code>, because that's where the
            <code>App</code> component is being used. This file is the entry
            point for our app, and it initially looks like this:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
  import ReactDOM from &#x27;react-dom&#x27;;
  import &#x27;./index.css&#x27;;
  import App from &#x27;./App&#x27;;
  import * as serviceWorker from &#x27;./serviceWorker&#x27;;

    ReactDOM.render(
      &#x3C;React.StrictMode&#x3E;
        &#x3C;App /&#x3E;
      &#x3C;/React.StrictMode&#x3E;,
      document.getElementById(&#x27;root&#x27;)
   );

  serviceWorker.unregister();
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            As with <code>App.js</code>, the file starts by importing all the JS
            modules and other assets it needs to run.
            <code>src/index.css</code> holds global styles that are applied to
            our whole app. We can also see our App component imported here; it
            is made available for import thanks to the export statement at the
            bottom of <code>App.js</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Line 7 calls React’s <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> function with
            two arguments:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The component we want to render, <code>&lt;App /&gt;</code> in
              this case.
            </li>
            <li>
              The DOM element inside which we want the component to be rendered,
              in this case the element with an ID of <code>root</code>. If you
              look inside <code>public/index.html</code>, you'll see that this
              is a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element just inside the
              <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All of this tells React that we want to render our React application
            with the <code>App</code> component as the root, or first component.

            Next, we'll use a few of our JavaScript skills to get a bit more
            comfortable editing components and working with data in React. We'll
            talk about how variables are used inside JSX, and introduce props,
            which are a way of passing data into a component (which can then be
            accessed using variables).

            This brings us to the end of our initial look at React, including
            how to install it locally, creating a starter app, and how the
            basics work. In the next article, we'll start building our first
            proper application — a todo list. Before we do that, however, let's
            recap some of the things we’ve learned.
          </p>
          <p>In React:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Components can import modules they need and must export themselves
              at the bottom of their files.
            </li>
            <li>Component functions are named with <code>PascalCase</code>.</li>
            <li>
              You can read JSX variables by putting them between curly braces,
              like <code>{so}</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some JSX attributes are different than HTML attributes so that
              they don't conflict with JavaScript reserved words. For example,
              <code>class</code> in HTML translates to <code>className</code> in
              JSX. Note that multi-word attributes are camel-cased.
            </li>
            <li>
              Props are written just like attributes inside component calls and
              are passed into components.
            </li>
          </ul>
